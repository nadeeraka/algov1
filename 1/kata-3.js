// XO("ooxXm") => true
// XO("zpzpzpp") => true // when no 'x' and 'o' is present should return true

// TODO

//   Freddy has a really fat left pinky finger, and every time Freddy tries to type an A, he accidentally hits the CapsLock key!

// Given a string that Freddy wants to type, emulate the keyboard misses where each A supposedly pressed is replaced with CapsLock, and return the string that Freddy actually types. It doesn't matter if the A in the string is capitalized or not. When CapsLock is enabled, capitalization is reversed, but punctuation is not affected.

// Examples:

// "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."

// Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a chemical found in the nucleus of cells and carries the "instructions" for the development and functioning of living organisms.

// If you want to know more http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA

// In DNA strings, symbols "A" and "T" are complements of each other, as "C" and "G". You have function with one side of the DNA (string, except for Haskell); you need to get the other complementary side. DNA strand is never empty or there is no DNA at all (again, except for Haskell).

// Your team is writing a fancy new text editor and you've been tasked with implementing the line numbering.

// Write a function which takes a list of strings and returns each line prepended by the correct number.

// The numbering starts at 1. The format is n: string. Notice the colon and space in between.

// Examples:

// number([]) // => []
// number(["a", "b", "c"]) // => ["1: a", "2: b", "3: c"]

function number(arr) {
  let newArray = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
